NOTE: this was created and tested on a Windows 11 machine, 
      so the following steps will also assume a Windows 11 machine

1. Download and install Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/en/download
2. Download the zip file (named "hprabowo-amartha.zip") to your machine
3. Unzip the file to any directory (i.e. the default based on the file name is "hprabowo-amartha")
4. Open a command prompt to that directory
5. run "npm install" (you may be prompted to install a newer version of npm)
6. run "npm run test"
7. The test will run and at the end will show a command to display the test report: "npx playwright show-report"
8. The test report will show each test result, which can be clicked to show step details and attachments
